         "Zygote DLC - NEWZygote DLCJuly 12th, 2017Once you have installed the base Oats Studios – Volume 1 Assets launcher in your Software Library, you will have a set of optional DLC related to Zygote that you can choose to install from that same location. Please read the description below to find out more information about what’s in each folder and their respective size and below that, a description of how best to unpack the 3d assets.The Zygote DLC includes the following:Zygote 3d Models: - 23.6GBZygote – 13.7GBSynthetic Skulls for Print – 509MBZygote Concept Art Booklet – Total size: 500 MB – File Name: Zygote_Booklet_v2Concept ArtVFX look-developmentOats Workshop BTS SelectsFilming BTS selectsZygote High Resolution Video (Stereo)OatsZygoteDLCStereo.mp4 – 5.70GB320 kbps AAC Stereo Audio1920x1080h.264 40mbit/sec (approximately Blu-Ray quality)Zygote High Resolution Video (Surround)OatsZygoteDLCSurround.mp4 – 5.77GB640 kbps AAC 5.1 Surround Audio1920x1080h.264 40mbit/sec (approximately Blu-Ray quality)Zygote ScriptA few general notes about all 3D assets uploaded for Zygote.LOOKDEVThese folders contain the assembled 3dsmax file used for final rendering.  They also contain all the necessary textures in the directory structure that should ensure everything is correctly linked.  It’s a very deep directory structure but it was the easiest way to collect the data to share with the community.  You can of course remap the directory structure on your own to simplify it.These files (and shaders) are set-up to be used with Redshift (our renderer of choice).  However, you can rebuild them to work in whatever renderer you choose.The model in this file is our working resolution (with displacement maps to render like the highres sculpt)The model in this file is in the T-pose (NOT the pose displayed in the thumbnail)MODELWe provide a series of various model files and formats.Cleaned up mudbox file with high and low resolution meshes (used for exporting our various displacements and working resolution models.Two .obj files, one the lowres working model and one high resolution sculptAll of these models are in the default T-pose (not the pose displayed in the thumbnail)RIGThere are two files here, both Maya files (the program we use for animation)One file is the “fast” animation rig.  This file does not contain the final working resolution mesh but instead contains a lower resolution cut-up mesh for fast animation interactivity.  Its rig also is a stripped-down version missing some of the slower fancy things.  Basically, this is the rig the animators work with 95% of the time.The second file contains the same rig but with the full working resolution mesh with skinning.  It also contains extra bits in the rig to assist with skinning or secondary motion.  It is THIS file that you would export a model cache (whatever format you wish) from to then apply to the lookdev model for rendering.The rigs are set-up to make use of the Maya referencing system so that if rig is REFERENCED in you can swap the reference on the fly.  To use this do not animate directly in the rig file.  *** As a final note if you have issues or questions pertaining to any of these files please go to the Oats Studios Forum in the DLC category and ask away: Stream Oats Studios Shorts Free on SteamAbout the SoftwareAt Oats Studios, the creation of Volume 1 required immense resources.

Combining large-scale strategy, in-depth tactics, and open world exploration, Godless Tactics makes you the master of the new world's most potent fighting force. Your victories, discoveries, and choices, will decide the fate of all.~ PLOT ~In the year 2099 the air was poisoned, and humanity fled underground. It was nearly 800 years before it was safe to walk the Earth without a respirator, and a lot had changed. Sea levels fell, the climate warmed, and entire civilisatons were torn down to feed the network of underground refuges.Many didn't make it to the 'all clear'. Among those that did were three huge refuges in the UK and France: Lumida, Medan, and Dunra. Their leaders all had their own vision for the future of their people - and everyone else's people, for that matter. By the year 2952, the region was awash with war, fighting not with great machines or technical marvels, but swords, spears, and quick-witted courage. The great empire of 'Mesh'medan' has people aplenty to throw into combat. The mysterious domain called 'Yunber' is somehow fielding endless ranks of clones. How can the tiny state of 'Lumida' compete? That's where you come in.You are the leader of a newly formed elite combat unit, tasked by a high and mighty council of Refuge Lumida to intervene in this conflict. This team, the 'Agen Misson Lumida' in their language, or 'AML', must strike hard and fast where they are needed most, to fulfill the wishes of their masters. What are those wishes? Few can even begin to know...~ STRATEGISE ~Assess the entire theater of war, and decide how you can best achieve your goals. Will you push the frontlines with your allies? Fortify key locations? Intercept supply trains to hamper the enemy? Or outright conquer them head-on? Invest resources into settlements to get more boots on the ground, and pick your targets for maximum strategic effect. And be careful, because they might just decide to pick on you right back.Throughout the campaign your team and pool of recruits will grow stronger and stronger, even if many must fall, allowing you to venture ever deeper into hostile territory. The stronger you get, the more enemies will simply be crushed under your feet, allowing for devastating rampages through poorly prepared defences. Make use of Autoresolves to skip scuffles with these small fry by simulating the battles automatically, allowing for quick success when the enemy just aren't worth your time.And always keep in mind that your war-goals can shift, and that planning ahead for what may happen as fortunes shift could make all the difference in the end...~ BATTLE ~Turn based battles in the vein of Fire Emblem, but with extra tactical options. Use 'Boost' to have one unit empower another, and use 'Sync' abilities to dance around the enemy and land great numbers of attacks. Your units, called 'Agents', have different abilities according to their class, which can be further altered with choices of equipment, item usage, and the Boost system. You can freely view the damage, chance to hit and hit count of any attack, allowing you to work out how best to apply your strength to any situation. A master tactician must make use of how terrain features restrict movement or alter combat results. Withdraw agents and deploy fresh reserves to keep your squad alive as the damage comes in. Capture enemy bases to stem the tide of reinforcements when you're outnumbered.From simple move and attack strategies, to elaborate maneuvers using the whole team's strength to land one perfect blow, there are countless ways to proceed in combat. Master elite tactics to face down even powerful opponents! And if it's looking bad? Run away!~ EXPLORE ~The world is yet to be fully rebuilt, and plenty of relics from the 'Refuge Age' and before litter the region. By visiting 'Points of Interest' you can gain extra resources, scavenge equipment and items, or uncover new codex entries with insight into the lore. Some really out of the way ruins must still have some truly valuable treasures!Every settlement on the map comes with some lore information too, discussing its origin, its role in the modern world, or moments from its past. While all optional, you can use these guides to get a feel for the world you're travelling through, and perhaps for the world you wish to create...~ EXTRA ~Various alternate game modes, challenge options, and difficulty levels add replayability and fresh takes on the action!",

When you cross paths with the Boy, a small creature whose mysterious powers have attracted the attention of Gemini, the Mistress of the Artifacts, you decide to protect him, unaware that much greater forces are involved.EXPLORE ZENOZOIKDrawing upon both surreal and punk fantasy influences, the world and civilisations of Zenozoik are brimming with fascinating characters, creatures and landscapes. Roam this intriguing land and discover its paths, inhabitants and ancient secrets. CRUSH YOUR OPPONENTSYour fists and speed are your greatest weapons. Attack, dodge, stun, block, counter a parry to land a special attack, switch to first-person view to perform unique techniques: each time, it's up to you to seize the occasion to achieve victory and avoid mistakes that could quickly prove fatal. CUSTOMISE YOUR COMBAT STYLELearn various martial arts during your adventure and alternate freely between them based on the situation, types of enemies and your preference. Victories will enable you to improve your characteristics and upgrade your attacks, so you can develop your own unique style.  RISE TO THE CHALLENGE OF THE RITUALBefore fighting, you can challenge your opponent to a game of dice, with the winner defining the rules of the encounter – often to their advantage. Summoning a monster as an ally, covering the area in fog, having shackles limit movement…  far from determining the outcome of the combat, the Ritual represents an opportunity to exploit if you win it or a challenge to cleverly overcome if you lose.A RICH STORYLINEYour search for the Great Artifacts that will help you defeat Gemini will take you farther than you ever imagined. While taking on the mercenaries pursuing you and developing your friendship with the Boy, you must confront your past and delve into the sources of the chaotic society of Zenozoik. Clash: Artifacts of Chaos takes place in the same universe as Zeno Clash and Zeno Clash II, but the game is entirely independent.",

Sell what you capture to bank your gold now, or invest to gain more gold later?  It's a careful balance, but one you'll need to master.

It plays similarly to award-winning real-life board games like \"Splendor\" and \"Jaipur\". You collect resources (recruit villagers) which allow you to collect more resources (capture monsters), and build up a hand that can sell resources for victory points (gold) which determine the winner.  The strategy and tactics are all in deciding which resources of what type to get, when to get them, and then deciding how and when to convert them into your winnings.As with all good strategy games, the mechanics are straightforward.  Learning how to apply them to outsmart your opponent is where the enjoyment and challenge lies!Quick to learn, hard to master.Compete in a solo campaign & freeplay, or local & online multiplayer.Capture over 250 monsters across 8 fantasy realmsOutwit varied AI with different strategies to beat.Gain ranks to become the ultimate Monstermonger!",

Soon, the demons arrived to challenge the humans’ complacency, and unable to defend themselves, cities and fortresses fell, leaving the humans at the mercy of the demons.Amidst the chaos, a new hero has risen in the form of a young girl, Raji, who has been chosen by the gods to be the sole defender of the human race.

The entries in the the 9-nine- series share the same setting and world, but each entry focuses on a different heroine. The villainous mastermind is revealed, friends are at odds, the mystery of the Artifacts uncovered, and bonds are tightened through mutual trust. What lies in store for this young man and woman with the power of justice at their fingertips in this installment?This game differs from the other games in that the story structure assumes that you have already played the past titles (9-nine- Episodes 1-3.) You will be able to enjoy this as a standalone title as well, but we highly suggest that you play this game after playing the other titles in the series. Each game has an independent story that can be enjoyed on its own. We hope you enjoy the experience that is the 9-nine- series.9-nine- takes place in the run-of-the-mill college town of Shiromitsugawa where an earthquake breaks a sacred artifact from the Shrine of the White Serpent, unleashing jewelry-like items that bestow their holder's special powers called \"Artifacts\" from a parallel world. When an incident involving a power that transcends human comprehension, Kakeru Niimi, our protagonist, investigates several branches (parallel worlds) in order to settle the matter. With the mastermind finally revealed, Sophitia, otherworldly entity set to reclaim the Artifacts, tells him to defeat this person pulling the strings. The first day, the day that the festival was cancelled due to the earthquake back at the shrine—Kakeru is now equipped with memories from every branch and is on the move to solve this conflict. Amidst this, a girl with a strong sense of justice from Kuho Girls Academy, Noa Yuuki, has an ability that seems to be the key to defeating the mastermind. Knowing this, Kakeru divulges about the events in other branches to her. All the while uncovering the secrets behind why the Artifacts come to this world, settling the scores with the Evil Eye's User, what will be the fate of these young men and women with otherworldly power at the fingertips?Gorgeous art from Izumi Tsubasu (Artist of SakuSaku:Love Blooms with the Cherry Blossoms)Gripping story written by scenario writer, Kazuki FumiMulti part series with independent stories per episodeCG galleryMusic galleryMovie galleryFULL Japanese voice acting (Including the main character!)Japanese, English, and Chinese text.

It will help you in enhancing your experience with many useful features, including:  💪 Body tracking 👋 Head & hand tracking 🎮 Controller emulation 📺 t VR (virtual reality on monitor or TV) 🔧 Utilities WHAT MAKES DRIVER4VR STAND OUT?  🎮 Simple & powerful VR features 🥇 Years of experience & ongoing development 🤖 Lots of usage options (body tracking, controller emulation & more) 🌎 Global Discord community ⚙️ Easy setup & helpful tutorials 💰 Affordable price for a convenient VR tool  Driver4VR is also the main source of funding for Walkin VR, the first software that allows people with disabilities to play VR games.  MANY WAYS OF BODY TRACKING  This VR solution allows adding body tracking for existing VR setups like Oculus, HTC Vive or Valve Index. It can emulate body tracking with:Puppeteer - actually emulation with hand controllers :)Kinect Web Camera Oculus CV1 Touch Controllers Nolo VRPS Controllers with PS Eye cameras via PS Move Service Ex Camera Markers with PS Eye Camera VR ON MONITOR OR TV Driver4VR allows users to play some VR games on TV  (this solution is called t VR). It’s an alternative way to use VR content for people who for some reason can't do it in a classic way (with headset and controllers).3DOF and 6DOF TRACKING POSSIBILITIES  For 3Do F Headsets like phone-vr, PSVR or VR Tek, Driver4VR can add position tracking and controller emulation. It also uses alternative devices (previous generation consoles, mice, keyboard) to emulate virtual reality controllers and input.  Additionally, it can add positional tracking (6Do F) in case you have a headset that just supports the rotation like phone-based VR, VR Tek, Pimax, etc. It uses Kinect to emulate positional tracking.  Please note that we are using alternative tracking methods to approximate a true 6DOF experience. You may want to look into Oculus Quest or similar devices at a cheap price for the head and hands tracking and use Driver4VR for only the body tracking - feet and waist.SMART CONTROLLER EMULATION  Controllers can be emulated with devices like PS Move, Joy-Con, Wii Remote, VR Gamepad, Mouse, Xbox Controller, Keyboard. Combined with positional tracking, it makes a complete virtual reality setup with hand tracking and input.  Without Kinect you can use those devices alone to emulate position a'la Oculus Go which is called Virtual Tracking.USEFUL VR UTILITIES  Driver4VR is also a set of useful virtual reality utilities like e.g. Virtual Move, Input Emulation, fix floor position, emulation of broken Index thumbstick with touchpad and many others.REQUIREMENTS  Bluetooth devices (Bluetooth connection required):Nintendo Switch Joy Con Nintendo Wii Remote PS3 Move / PS4 Move VR Gamepad Web Camera: Any PC Compatible Web Camera Kinect:Kinect 360 - Kinect 360 adapter and standard USB 2.0 Kinect 2.0 - Kinect 2.0 adapter and USB 3.0 IMPORTANT UPDATES & SUPPORT  PSVR Display Driver and PS4 Camera tracking goes out of support by end of June 2024. Wii Remote model RVL-CNT-01-TR is not yet supported at the moment but working on it. When using the Driver4VR for the first time, it MUST be started from the \"Launch\" button, to ensure any additional services and drivers it requires get installed.

Simply launch any supported game while View Tracker is running and begin using the position of your head to change your view in-game. Enjoy stable and responsive head tracking with no hardware requirement other than a supported webcam.Gamers have been using head tracking for years and many find it indispensable. It has proven to be especially suitable for simulator games such as flight sims or racing/vehicle sims. Using your head to change your view feels natural and allows you to keep your hands on the controls while looking around.Most head tracking solutions involve devices that must be worn on your head and are either expensive or require a lot of time and effort to build yourself. View Tracker is able to be accurate and reliable while only using a webcam. It uses recent machine learning techniques that have been adapted specifically for head tracking and works well even if you wear glasses or have objects in the background.View Tracker uses some of your computer’s resources to run the tracking, but care has been taken to minimize its impact on gaming performance. It doesn’t use graphics card resources and makes use of CPU resources that are often left unused when gaming on modern multi-core processors.Most webcams should be compatible as long as they provide at least 30 FPS at at 640x480 resolution or above. It must have a 64-bit driver for Windows 10 and be Direct Show compatible.View Tracker requires that you are connected to the internet and logged-on to Steam in order to run.Any game that has a head tracking option should be compatible with View Tracker.

The Hexels grid allows artists to create complex vector designs with the stroke of a brush. It is a new kind of workflow that's intuitive and easy to pick up by a beginner, and a versatile tool in the hands of a pro.Pixelate The grid-based canvas in Hexels is a natural fit for the forward-thinking pixel artist. Make full use of the same great drawing tools. Keep track of colors and gradients with the palette. Set your canvas in motion with the animation timeline. Export a sprite sheet for every princess in every castle.Construct For the craftsman looking to build worlds, Hexels provides a set of grids and guides for drafting all forms of isometric art. Raise walls, carve mountains, bend perspective to your will and build impossible wonders.Detail Pixels and Trixels living in harmony! Hexels lets you combine layers of vector and pixel art on the same canvas. Complement angular Hexel art with soft, sweeping brushwork. Carve pixel-perfect trim into isometric art. Block out whole cities in vector form, then dive in for the details.Rasterize Hexels gives you full control over the vector-to-pixel rendering process. Advanced rasterization tools provide vector alignment, pixel-perfect isometric art, pixel scaling, and antialiasing at any export resolution. And because Hexels renders everything on the GPU, you'll see a pixel-perfect preview on the canvas as you paint.Animate Build a world and bring it to life with the Hexels animation timeline. Breathe subtle motion into a still image with post effects and motion curves. Send shapes and colors twirling with layer transforms. Or tell a hand-drawn tale with a simple flipbook animation.Pattern Hexels is the perfect tool for exploring tiling designs and geometries. Paint tessellating patterns on an endless canvas. Explore advanced grid types like Voronoi. Draft your own grids with a powerful custom grid designer. Whether you are creating textiles or laying out an elaborate mosaic, Hexels can help.Design Hexels is a versatile tool for the graphic artist working with multiple applications, at a print-ready resolution. Assemble your canvas out of existing images and animations.\tKeep organized with layers, masks and groups. Add a pinch of procedural with a library of real-time post effects and shaders. Then export an SVG or layered PSD of your canvas for final touch-ups elsewhere.Featured artwork by:Mark Knight, Mira Karouta, etall, Saskia Freeke, Will Wantz, Jen Maynulet, Jakobsen Beck, Charred, Ed Clews, Brunélie Lauret, Thomas Lonsdale, Beth Mohler, Andres Reinot, Tabby Rose",

Objects - trees, signs, barriers, pit stands, cones, tyres, fences - all can now be added into your track. Complex Objects - parent-child relations create a more complex object with greater variety.  String-Objects - Make long lines (strings) of objects and quickly move them about as your design evolves. Walls - edit the cross-section and customise the look of walls. Start/Pits/Timing Positions - Set Grid/Pit positions and Timing Gates that are exported to AC. Fast Undo/Redo. Windows 64 bit support. 16k & 8k textures in addition to lower resolutions already supported. Super fast GPU texture painting.Additional functions will be added as free upgrades as they are developed. Many of the BTB functions will be integrated into the new interface and many entirely new features are planned as upgrades occur each month. More Terrain editing tools for greater control. Objects - more content and improved interface. String-Objects - more content and align-to-track tool. Intersections - pre-textured sections will make intersections a cinch. Expansion Packs (Xpacks) including additional textures, materials, objects, string-object and cross-sections definitions. ... and much more.RTB exports to the Autodesk FBX format which can then be loaded into 3d modelling tools for export into games with a little more work. This opens up RTB to more game developers and this in turn will generate more RTB content (X Packs) for people to use across all types of games. In time export direct to game may be added for some titles but initially the focus is on supporting many titles.The first title with specific support is Assetto Corsa with materials and shaders created to replicate the shading used. The landscape uses Multilayering shading with support for direct modification of the underlying texture. When targeting Assetto Corsa the export prepares the objects ready to be imported into the AC Editor, generating the Configuration file so that materials and textures are applied as they appearred in RTB.More information ...

         "COMING SOON ! Wishlist now.NEW BY 3DM !MORE 3DM LIVE WALLPAPERS About the Software Windows 10 / 11 Only.Planet Evolution PC Live Wallpaper Unique wallpaper every time!.The universe is infinitely full of planets that evolve over billions of years! Choose your planet and observe it from beginning to end.Your planet will evolve over time. From rocks covered with lava to planets that look like our earth with developed civilizations on its surface.Be a witness of the transformation of the planet from its beginnings. From planets covered with rocks, desert or ice to those looks like the moon or mars.A planet like our \"Earth\" is a rarity, but with a bit of luck, you can see it. Planets capable of sustaining life can have civilizations visible at night These civilizations can reach 3 levels, poorly grooved, crossed and futuristic Highly developed civilizations can quickly destroy the planet turning it into a toxic place full of poisonous liquids and gases.Main features:- Procedural planets that are evolving in front of your eyes.- The procedural environment that also changes with the time of evolution.- Procedural cameras that will always provide you with amazing views.- Optimized consumption of CPU / GPU resources. Thanks to the procedural shaders.- Support for multiple screens. Include a feature for Wide and Ultrawide screens.- Includes the \"Game Mode\" feature to minimize the wallpaper while playing normal games.- Menu options where you can manage your wallpaper.- Updates in the future. The project will evolve like this planet.- And more... some little features.Performance:Efficiency is our priority! This project is mostly built of procedural textures and the rest is loaded at the beginning. The consumption is very small but you can always set your options in the menu just like in a normal game.Multi, Wide, 4K screen users:The wallpaper will run at a maximum resolution. Higher resolution can have a slight effect on your computer's performance. However, I have a 4K screen and the performance drop is insignificant. You can change the FPS limit or shaders resolution. The menu includes a feature for Wide and Ultrawide screen users that change field of view (FOV).Procedurality of planets:Changes in the planet are not accidental or random. We tried to keep some realism, which means that we will never see the ice planet right after the magma.Support We are a small team that wants to create interactive applications that diversify known Windows wallpapers. We try to make each project unique, introducing something new on the screen. Each support is valuable for us. Ratings and comments help us move forward and create even better interactive wallpapers.Planet Evolution PC Live Wallpaper is a project that was created thanks to your help. Thank you very much and we encourage you to support it through reviews and activity in the community. Every help is very important to us. Thank you.If you notice any problems, check our \"Community HUB\" or contact directly. I'm almost 25h to your disposition ;)Thank you for support!3DM Team",

Whenever an opponent crashes while you're still in the game, you score a point. Get to the score limit first to win the game!Achtung die Kugel re-imagines the old classic \"Achtung die Kurve\". Achtung die Kugel bends achtung-space to kugel-space (sphere-space) and brings the same classic action and skillful gameplay you would expect from an achtung game.Here's what's in the package:- Action packed gameplay: one small mistake and you're out for the round!- Achtung die Kugel is played on a Sphere!!- Jumps! Get out of tight situations or get right in front of an opponent with this skill-intensive feature.- Easy to learn - hard to master: you can only go left, right or jump. But it takes lots of skill and tactics if you want to win the round!- Play up to 4 players in two teams or free for all.- Different maps to choose from.- Xbox controller support. Definitely plays best with controllers!- Party mode. Hate waiting for the end of each round? In party mode you respawn immediately!- Many settings for your ultimate achtung-on-a-sphere experience!We really hope you like it!Konec hry!",

When you cross paths with the Boy, a small creature whose mysterious powers have attracted the attention of Gemini, the Mistress of the Artifacts, you decide to protect him, unaware that much greater forces are involved.EXPLORE ZENOZOIK Drawing upon both surreal and punk fantasy influences, the world and civilisations of Zenozoik are brimming with fascinating characters, creatures and landscapes. Roam this intriguing land and discover its paths, inhabitants and ancient secrets. CRUSH YOUR OPPONENTS Your fists and speed are your greatest weapons. Attack, dodge, stun, block, counter a parry to land a special attack, switch to first-person view to perform unique techniques: each time, it's up to you to seize the occasion to achieve victory and avoid mistakes that could quickly prove fatal. CUSTOMISE YOUR COMBAT STYLE Learn various martial arts during your adventure and alternate freely between them based on the situation, types of enemies and your preference. Victories will enable you to improve your characteristics and upgrade your attacks, so you can develop your own unique style.  RISE TO THE CHALLENGE OF THE RITUAL Before fighting, you can challenge your opponent to a game of dice, with the winner defining the rules of the encounter – often to their advantage. Summoning a monster as an ally, covering the area in fog, having shackles limit movement…  far from determining the outcome of the combat, the Ritual represents an opportunity to exploit if you win it or a challenge to cleverly overcome if you lose.A RICH STORYLINE Your search for the Great Artifacts that will help you defeat Gemini will take you farther than you ever imagined. While taking on the mercenaries pursuing you and developing your friendship with the Boy, you must confront your past and delve into the sources of the chaotic society of Zenozoik. Clash: Artifacts of Chaos takes place in the same universe as Zeno Clash and Zeno Clash II, but the game is entirely independent.",

         "PC gaming is a quest for performance, a never-ending cycle of upgrading, overclocking, and tweaking your system for faster frame rates, higher resolutions, and better quality visual effects.3D Mark is essential equipment for this quest. For more than 20 years, 3D Mark has been the first choice for benchmarking, testing, and comparing PC performance.There'll always be a new game that demands more performance from your hardware. And there'll always be new hardware that delivers more performance for your games. And so the cycle continues. Welcome to 3D Mark, the Gamer's Benchmark.3D Mark includes everything gamers need to benchmark and compare PC performance. It has dedicated tests for all types of PC from lightweight laptops to dedicated desktops. 3D Mark will recommend the best benchmark for your hardware.3D Mark tests your system's GPU and CPU performance by rendering extremely demanding game-like scenes in real time. The faster the benchmark runs, the better your score. Now your quest begins. What can you do to get a better score?Start by comparing your 3D Mark score with results from other systems with the same hardware. Lower than average scores may indicate a problem with cooling, configuration, or faulty components. Higher than average scores show the potential for overclocking your hardware. And if you’re wondering what your 3D Mark score means for real-world game performance, 3D Mark also shows you the frame rates you can expect in a selection of popular games.Now see how much more performance you can get from your system. Update your drivers. Update Windows. Experiment with system settings. Run 3D Mark after every change to track your progress. Identify bottlenecks in your system and compare 3D Mark scores to help choose your next upgrade. Ask for advice, share tips, and show off your system in the 3D Mark Community Hub on Steam.Overclocking is an art that takes skill and precision. The goal is to squeeze every drop of performance out of your GPU and CPU. The reward is a free performance upgrade and the satisfaction of pushing your hardware beyond its stock performance.3D Mark is an essential tool for overclockers. Run 3D Mark before and after overclocking to measure the performance gain. Use custom benchmark settings to explore your PC's performance limits. Make 3D Mark tests more or less demanding by changing the resolution and other settings.Run 3D Mark Stress Tests to check the stability of your overclocks and the effectiveness of your cooling. 3D Mark Stress Tests run in a loop to put your system under heavy load for longer than a standard benchmark run.Challenge your friends to set the highest 3D Mark score or compete for the top spot in the 3D Mark Steam leaderboards.If you love PC gaming, there's nothing better than building your own custom PC. And if you build it yourself, there's nothing more nerve-racking than turning it on for the first time. Will it boot? Will everything work properly? Whether you're building a complete system from scratch or upgrading a component, 3D Mark has you covered.Run 3D Mark and compare your benchmark score with similar systems to make sure your new build is set up correctly. Detailed hardware monitoring charts show you how the CPU and GPU load, temperature, and clock speed changed during your benchmark run—ideal for identifying configuration issues.Use 3D Mark Stress Tests to check the stability of your system and discover faulty hardware while it's still under warranty. Stress testing is also a great way to test and optimize your system's cooling performance. A well-built PC with decent cooling should be able to deliver peak performance for the full duration of a 3D Mark Stress Test.3D Mark can help when you are planning an upgrade as well. Search and compare benchmark results from all the latest graphics cards and processors on the 3D Mark website to find the models that offer the best performance for your budget.PC gaming never stands still and neither does 3D Mark. Every year, we add new benchmarks, tests, and features. We update 3D Mark regularly so that you can benchmark the latest PC gaming hardware.

Additional options include a population density slider to control car and pedestrian traffic, as well as dual and triple monitor support, 3D compatibility, and plug-and-play controller support.  \n\r\nGrand Theft Auto V for PC also includes Grand Theft Auto Online, with support for 30 players and two spectators.

The Rockstar Editor’s Director Mode allows players the ability to stage their own scenes using prominent story characters, pedestrians, and even animals to bring their vision to life. Along with advanced camera manipulation and editing effects including fast and slow motion, and an array of camera filters, players can add their own music using songs from GTAV radio stations, or dynamically control the intensity of the game’s score. Completed videos can be uploaded directly from the Rockstar Editor to You Tube and the Rockstar Games Social Club for easy sharing.  \n\r\nSoundtrack artists The Alchemist and Oh No return as hosts of the new radio station, The Lab FM. The station features new and exclusive music from the production duo based on and inspired by the game’s original soundtrack.
